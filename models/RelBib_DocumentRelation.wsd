Description:    These bibliographic models are developed to consolidate and standardize the data models used for bibliographic and citation purposes.
                These models are meant to be fully compatible with ISO 690 and ISO TC 46â€™s (and SC 4, SC 9) work on bibliography.
                They are used extensively in the following projects as containers for bibliographic data management and for managing document metadata:

                - ISO Standards
                - CSD Standards
                - Chinese Standards (GB and family)
                - ISO bibliography gem

                Below are the UML diagrams.
                The document models are expressed as UML and as RelaxNG Compact (RNC) grammars; see discussion under Grammars. This repository contains the RNC grammars for the base BibliographicItem model, Citation model and the Contributor model.
                The document models are currently used by IsoDoc-based authoring tools for standards, which convert Asciidoctor source to XML representations of the document models, and validate the XML generated against the RNC schemas:

                - https://github.com/riboseinc/asciidoctor-csd
                - https://github.com/riboseinc/asciidoctor-gb

                They are also used by tools that render those XML representations of the document models, into HTML and Microsoft Word:

                - https://github.com/riboseinc/isodoc
